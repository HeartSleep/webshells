Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak and Hublot’s Big Bang luxury watches both have an interesting history and have drawn many comparisons for their respective designs, <a href="http://www.keptwatches.com">replica rolex watches</a> replica rolex watches  which have both spawned many editions and variations. Let me cover both their stories before I compare some similarly-styled models.Arnold for Royal Oak vs Jet Li for Big BangThe Royal Oak by Audemars Piguet was established by Jules-Louis Audemars and Edward-Auguste Piguet in 1874. A global icon of horology, they have always been considered one of the world’s best watchmakers. In 1972, they invented the first luxury sports watch, with the Royal Oak. It was considered a risk for the company, as some thought that the concept and lower pricing would hurt the brand name, and also that no one would want to pay a luxury premium for a sports watch. First released in high-grade steel, its simple octagonal design, <a href="http://www.keptwatches.com">fake hublot watches</a> fake hublot watches  <a href="http://www.keptwatches.com">fake hublot watches</a> fake hublot watches  inspired by a naval porthole, quickly became a hit, with sales far exceeding Audemars Piguet’s expectations. Since the original steel model, countless variations of precious metals, jewels, sub dials and tourbillions have been released.The Big Bang by Hublot is relatively young in the world of horology, having been founded by Carlo Crocco in 1976. His first watch showcased the world’s first all-natural rubber strap. It received little attention when it was first released in 1980 at the Basel Watch Fair, but sales soon picked up. In 2005, Jean-Claude Biver, former president of , joined Hublot and created the Big Bang. This watch was an immediate success, both critically and commercially, with sales tripling in a year. The Big Bang received three awards at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix: "2005 Design Prize" "Sports Watch Prize" and "Watch of the Year".The Royal Oak vs. the Big BangTo compare, I see the Royal Oak being an upstart for its time in the 1970s, with the Big Bang also making a big splash with its debut in the mid-2000s. The Royal Oak is now a classic <a href="http://www.keptwatches.com/IWC---Portuguese-Power-Reserve-IWC---90-1222908851-top.html"><img src="http://www.keptwatches.com/images/uploads/iwc/1222908851_3499.jpg" title="Iwc Portuguese Power Reserve Iwc 90 "></a> , with the Big Bang being a modern hit. With the Audemars Piguet name, Royal Oaks are on average more expensive than the Big Bang, but Hublot also offers pricier models as well. The Royal Oak is favoured by traditional watch, while the Big Bang is favoured by a more fashion-forward, generally younger crowd. Both offer models with a wide variety of materials, colors, coatings, straps, jewels, and sub-dials, for both men and women. With both watches still showing high popularity, both have a variety of celebrity ambassadors, as well as sporting, charity and event sponsorships.Royal Oak Steel vs. Big Bang SteelHere I am comparing , with . While steel is the original Royal Oak style, the modern Big Bang is known more for its flashy appearance <a href="http://www.keptwatches.com">hublot replica watches</a> hublot replica watches , and is rarely seen as naked as this model. Both basic models only offer automatic movements with the date, with the Royal Oak being 1mm wider than the Big Bang. The Royal Oak in steel costs about $14,000 with the Big Bang in steel at about $8,000. Audemars commands a higher price, <a href="http://www.keptwatches.com">fake hublot watch</a> fake hublot watch  if not for quality of craftsmanship, on just the name alone.Royal Oak Steel vs. Big Bang SteelRoyal Oak Chronograph Gold vs. Big Bang Chronograph Gold Here I am comparing both models when featured in gold, with  and .

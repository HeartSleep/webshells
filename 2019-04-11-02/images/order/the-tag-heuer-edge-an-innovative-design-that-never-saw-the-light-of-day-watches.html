<br> Our buddy &ndash; the titan on TAG, the Hercules of Heuer (otherwise known as Calibre 11) has been on a roll lately. Last week he shed some light on the little known Heuer Easy-Rider. And this week he&rsquo; <a href="http://www.fixreplicawatches.com/Replica-Omega-Watches.html">high quality replica omega watches</a> s discovered yet another obscure Heuer, or rather TAG-Heuer. Say hello to the TAG Heuer Edge, conceived in the late 90s but never saw the light of day.<br> The Edge was a watch intended to compliment the venerable Professional range as an entry-level quartz. The Edge was a design unlike another other Heuer, with an oversized, square case and a rather unusual squared rotating bezel.<br> We&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that TAG-Heuer in the late 90s produced some pretty ho hum watches, but we reckon the Edge is a decent enough looking watch, and would probably have done well had it been produced. <a href="http://www.fixreplicawatches.com">dive watch</a> <br> Why didn&rsquo;t the Edge get produced, you ask? Well, it turns out that in 1999 LVMH bought TAG Heuer out <a href="http://www.fixreplicawatches.com/Omega-Skeleton-Automatic-with-Black-Leather-Strap-Watch-fix128996.html"><img src="http://www.fixreplicawatches.com/images/uploads/Omega/skeleton/128996/1289961.jpg" alt="Omega Skeleton Automatic with Black Leather Strap" /></a> , and the new CEO, Jean-Christophe Babin had a different vision for the brand, one with less of a focus on &lsquo;entry level&rsquo; and more of a focus on refreshing the collection and increasing prestige. <br><br> To read the full story, check out the Calibre 11 post. <br> <a href="http://www.fixreplicawatches.com/Rolex-Day-Date-Ii-Watches.html">replica rolex day date ii</a>

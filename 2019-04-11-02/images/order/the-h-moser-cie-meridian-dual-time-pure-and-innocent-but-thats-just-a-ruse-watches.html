02:fifteen, eleven.Apr 2012 <br> Tourbillons <a href="http://www.mike646.com/Replica-Audemars-Piguet-Watches.html">fake audemars piguet</a> , chronograph counters and retrogrades are excellent for people who appreciate a flurry of dial activity &#8211; <a href="http://www.mike646.com/Replica-Piaget-Watches.html">replica piaget watches</a>  for those who prefer the simplicity of a watch face uncluttered with such accoutrements a H. Moser & Cie watch should do the trick, and this is the new H. Moser & Cie Meridian Dual Time. But do not let the plainness deceive you, H. Moser & Cie have a knack for hiding complex innovations within a pure and innocent exterior. <br><br> The piece features the brand's first automatic calibre the HMC 345.121 which features a dual time zone complication &#8211; and a few other ingenious additions. The aperture at 12 o'clock is an AM/PM display it's big and clear, but it's not as straightforward as it would appear. A slide system which features the numbers 1, 2 and 4 moves from side to side, only showing the desired number for the indication while the other remains hidden from view on the left or on the right, it's clever spring-operated system has it's own power source stored up over a period of 8 hours, <a href="http://www.mike646.com/Replica-IWC-Spitfire-UTC-Automatic-with-Brown-Dial-Watch-35918.html"><img src="http://www.mike646.com/images/uploads/IWC/Others/35918/359181.jpg" alt="Replica IWC Spitfire UTC Automatic" /></a>  so the movements reserve of power is unaffected. <br><br> Then there is the H. Moser & Cie Double Pull Crown Mechanism, a patented foolproof winding system which only the most inept user could fail to use with accuracy &#8211; for the Meridian Dual Time watch, the system will ensure that the home time is not adjusted by mistake and that the watch is not accidentally stopped while settings are being adjusted. <br><br> The new calibre has a boast-worthy power reserve of 72 hours which it gains though it's solid gold rotor which in turn delivers it's power via a pawl wheel winding system which can be wound in both directions. <br><br> That's not all &#8211 <a href="http://www.mike646.com">best replica watches</a> ; Moser have pioneered an interchangeable escapement, unscrewable at 2 points which enables ease of servicing, and these are no ordinary escapements, each is made from solid gold as is the pallet fork. The movement also uses a Straumann Hairspring and a Breguet Overcoil, terms which you may neither know or understand &#8211; but be assured, the blend of traditional techniques and modern innovation together with the superlative craftsmanship ensures that each piece is made to Haute Horlogerie standards, no exceptions. <br><br> And so to the dial, subtle recessing and contrasting finishing create an impeccable and classical exterior. The markers are slender and the hands taper to eyelash-slim proportions. The little red second time zone hand tucks away neatly behind the hour hand when not required and remains hidden. The rounded 40.8mm case features graining and polished finishes and lugs which curve away gently. <br><br> The H. Moser & Cie Meridian &#8211; Dual Time watch will be available in two editions, 18ct. rose gold with a silvered dial or in platinium with an Ardoise slate dial. <br><br> More from H.
